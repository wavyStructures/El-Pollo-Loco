                <h3>How do I win the game?</h3>
                <p>Your goal is to avoid dying and defeat the endboss. Collect coins, exchange them for bottles, defeat
                    enemies and the endboss in a final battle to win the game!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="single-box">
                <h3>How do I control Pepe?</h3>
                <p>You can make Pepe move to the left and to the right using the arrow keys. Press the space bar to make
                    him jump. Use "D" for throwing bottles and "W" to buy a bottle using 5 of your collected coins. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="single-box">
                <h3>How do I defeat enemies?</h3>
                <p>There are two ways to defeat enemies. You can jump on them from above or throw bottles at them. If
                    you throw enough bottles, you can defeat the endboss!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="single-box">
                <h3>What happens if Pepe gets injured?</h3>
                <p>If Pepe is hit by chickens or chicks, he gets injured and loses a life. Be careful and try to avoid
                    the enemies or defeat them before they hit you. Make sure to defeat the endboss before he might hit
                    you!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="single-box">
